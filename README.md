# Portfolio-Construction (Jan 2022)
Using convex optimisation to construct a portfolio of risky assets

The goal for this project was to test my coding skills in a topic relevant to my interests. Portfolio construction is incredibly important in finance and it is something I am learning in my university studies, therefore I wanted to see how it could be automated using coding and if it would be successful. To complete this project I used my coding foundational knowledge, in Python, as well as information from various sources on the internet for more specific coding challenges. The project challenged my ability to do research on my own for very specific problems and strengthened my problem solving skills.
